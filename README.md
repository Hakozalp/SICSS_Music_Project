# Fear and Loathing during the Pandemic: the changes in what we listen to in response to macroeconomic indicators.
We want to find out how people’s preferences for music change during the pandemic in the UK and Turkey, as a response to the idisoyncratic ways the pandemic unfolded in two countries. To answer this broad question we will look into music data in Spotify, Youtube, and Twitter to track people’s feelings manifesting through music taste.

Our research question is: How do external conditions such as changing social, economic and political circumstances affect preferences for music at the aggregate level?
